APP.js - This is a React component that provides a GUI to interact with the Immutable X SDK. It imports several components from the antd library to create input fields and buttons, and also imports a helper library (sdkImxWeb) to interact with the blockchain. The component contains several functions to handle different interactions with the blockchain, such as buying or selling items, canceling orders, and transferring tokens. It also contains state variables to store input values, a list of orders, the user's wallet address, and the user's balance. When the user interacts with the GUI, the corresponding functions are called and the appropriate state variables are updated. Finally, the component renders the input fields, buttons, and some additional data (such as the user's wallet address and balance) in the GUI. It also renders a list of orders retrieved from the blockchain, if any.
okImxWeb.js - This is a JavaScript code that exports an object named okImxWeb that provides functions to interact with the Immutable X blockchain platform using the "@imtbl/imx-sdk" library.The object provides functions for setting up an Immutable X account, getting user balances, transferring ERC721 tokens, selling and buying assets, getting orders and assets, canceling orders, and depositing assets. The functions use the "Link" and "ImmutableXClient" classes from the "@imtbl/imx-sdk" library, and the object is exported as the default export of the module.
